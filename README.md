# NHC Data
Analysis of New Hanover County Data

## Goals
The goal of this project is to track corporate influence in property ownership in New Hanover County and to find other
interesting trends over time within publicly available county data.

## Questions
1. How many, what percentage, and what is the tax assessed value of lots that are owned by commercial entities?
2. What are the top 10 owners by acreage and # of lots?
3. Are there zoned residential properties that are vacant and being held without development? May require correlation with tax data
4. What % of residential properties are being used for AirBNB/VRBO? May not be possible to identify long term rentals

## Filtering / Viewing
Analysis should be done on a monthly basis to observe trends.
There should be options to filter data on Wilmington incorporated lots only, and residential zoned lots.
